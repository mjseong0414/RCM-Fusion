# Abstract
While LiDAR sensors have been successfully applied to 3D object detection, the affordability of radar and camera sensors has led to a growing interest in fusing radars and cameras for 3D object detection. However, previous radar-camera fusion models could not fully utilize the potential of radar information. In this paper, we propose {\it Radar-Camera Multi-level fusion} (RCM-Fusion), which attempts to fuse both modalities at feature and instance levels. For feature-level fusion, we propose a {\it Radar Guided BEV Encoder} which transforms camera features into precise BEV representations using the guidance of radar Birdâ€™s-Eye-View (BEV) features and combines the radar and camera BEV features. For instance-level fusion, we propose a {\it Radar Grid Point Refinement} module that reduces localization error by accounting for the characteristics of the radar point clouds. The experiments on the public nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our proposed RCM-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performances among single frame-based radar-camera fusion methods in the nuScenes 3D object detection benchmark.
